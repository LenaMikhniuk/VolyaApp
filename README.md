## Technologies info
In this project, I am using the following:

* Get data from Weather API with search and Geolocation
* Use Freezed for data objects and serialization
* Store photos data in database with Sqflite


## Setup
To run this project:
* Clone URL
* Type $ flutter pub get in the command line
* Type $ flutter flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs (because  of using freezed package)
